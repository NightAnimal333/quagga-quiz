# Description
This is a simple quiz app made as my Mobile Programming assignment. You can just clone the repository and run it via Android Studio on an emulator or a real devce.
There is a autocompiled APK file included, but you will not be able to install it on your phone simply by downloading, since Android does not allow that.
